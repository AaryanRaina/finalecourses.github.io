             When teens were surveyed to find out why they started using drugs in the first place, 55% replied that it was due to pressure from their friends. They wanted to be cool and popular. Dealers know this.             
             <br> <br>
             They will approach you as a friend and offer to “help you out” with “something to bring you up.” The drug will “help you fit in” or “make you cool.”             
             <br><br>
             <strong>Drug dealers, motivated by the profits they make, will say anything to get you to buy their drugs.</strong>           
            <br><br>
            They will tell you that “cocaine will make your life a party” and that “heroin is a warm blanket.” If you take Ecstasy, “you can be with a lot of girls.”            
            <br><br>
            <strong>They don’t care if the drugs ruin your life as long as they are getting paid.</strong> All they care about is money. Former dealers have admitted they saw their buyers as “pawns in a chess game.”
